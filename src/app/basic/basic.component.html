      <p class="myPara">Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web.
        Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling,
        and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers
        developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop</p>

    <strong>Why this Page and whom does it concern?</strong><hr>
    <p>
      This Page/Repo is for everyone developing Angular Apps, For <u>Beginners</u> it like a mini project with all the basic and some advanced concepts that are
      required in web apps now a days & for <u>Intermediate or Professionals</u> it is like a one stop point to find some concepts we might forget while bumping into web apps.
      <br><br>I always felt that code gives the best possible explanation to any concept that a framework has to offer this repo explains
      all the concepts using Code, for documentation i will have links in each of the pages corresponding to the topics.
